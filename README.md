# NewYork_GreenTaxis

This project is an analysis on the data collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about <strong> "Green" </strong> Taxis. Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated areas of Manhattan

The analysis is on the September 2015 dataset. Link to download dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/green_tripdata_2015-09.csv)

Let's start the analysis by importing the necessary python modules for assitance.
